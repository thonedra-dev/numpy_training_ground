## 🎓 Learning Tips

### For Complete Beginners
1. **Don't rush** - Spend time understanding each NumPy operation
2. **Experiment freely** - Modify code and observe results
3. **Visualize often** - Use matplotlib to see what's happening
4. **Start simple** - Begin with MNIST before moving to CIFAR-10

### Best Practices
- ✅ Run notebooks sequentially from Day 1
- ✅ Complete all NumPy exercises before models
- ✅ Take notes on concepts you find challenging
- ✅ Try modifying model architectures
- ✅ Compare results across different approaches

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
